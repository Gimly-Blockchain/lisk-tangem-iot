= Workshop Part 0: Installation and Setup
:toc: preamble
:experimental:

This document will explain how to prepare your computer for the workshop.

== Requirements

=== Hardware
**Bring your own laptop.**
The tutorial supports both Mac, Linux, and Windows.

=== Software Prerequisites
Basic requirements for all machines:

* A code editor like Visual Studio Code
* Git

IMPORTANT: If you run a Windows machine, or just want a straight-forward setup of all required dependencies to get started with the workshop, follow our guide xref:./DOCKER.md[how to setup a development environment with Docker].
If you decide to follow this guide, you can skip the rest of this document.

Otherwise, you have to manually install:

* Node.js `v10` (use `nvm` for easy switching between versions in case you have a different version installed)
* Have Postgres installed (https://lisk.io/documentation/lisk-sdk/setup.html[Installation guide by Lisk]).

== 1.0 Setup

Set up the needed software and hardware and installation of the dependencies.

IMPORTANT: If you run into troubles during the setup, or just want a straight-forward setup of all required dependencies to get started with the workshop, follow our guide xref:./DOCKER.md[how to setup a development environment with Docker].

=== Clone the repo and install the dependencies

The below steps describe how to create the initial files for this tutorial.

["loweralpha"]
. Clone the Lisk-SDK-Examples repository locally.
+
[source,bash]
----
git clone https://github.com/LiskHQ/lisk-sdk-examples.git
cd lisk-sdk-examples
cd transport
----
+
The basic file structure looks as following:
+
.Contents of `lisk-sdk-examples/transport`

<2> Contains the code for the xref:./Workshop2.adoc#project-architecture[IoT application]
<3> Contains the code for the xref:./Workshop2.adoc#project-architecture[node application]
<4> Contains the custom transactions, that are used by the node and client app.
. Navigate inside `transport/transactions` and `transport/node` folders and run `npm install` to install the required dependencies for the node application.
+
[source,bash]
----
cd transactions
npm install
cd ../node
npm install
----
. Setup the database:
.. You can skip this step unless you have experimented before with Lisk. If yes, it is possible you have to first drop your database and recreate it with: `dropdb lisk_dev && createdb lisk_dev --owner lisk`.
. To verify if the setup is correct, try to run the application with
+
[source,bash]
----
node index.js | npx bunyan -o short
----
This command will run the `index.js` file and pipe the outputted logs to our preferred log formatting tool Bunyan.
Starting the node for the first time might require some time (up to 3 minutes)!

If everything is running fine, you can stop the node by hitting kbd:[CTRL+C].

WARNING: In case the node crashes or doesn't work, follow the xref:./DOCKER.md[this guide] to set up a dedicated development environment using Docker and Docker-Compose.
The script will set up the whole environment.

=== Prepare the IoT device

[INFO]
====
The IoT device has already been prepared for you before the workshop.
**No work needed here!** You can expand the section below if you want to learn about how we have set up the Raspbery Pi.
Note that we won't be using the Temperature and Humidity sensors during the workshop.

Sensor wiring::
image:iot/lisk_rpi_ldr_and_temperature_sensors_wiring.png[RPI Wiring, title="RPI Wiring"]

Preparing the Operating System::
The operating system for the Raspberry needs to be copied from a computer into an SD card for this we recommend using https://www.balena.io/etcher/ (good tutorial in https://medium.com/@ccarnino/backup-raspberry-pi-sd-card-on-macos-the-2019-simple-way-to-clone-1517af972ca5)
+
For preparing the Raspberry for `ssh` and wifi access follow this guide: https://core-electronics.com.au/tutorials/raspberry-pi-zerow-headless-wifi-setup.html
+
As we want to run the Raspberry in headless mode (i.e. no keyboard, mouse and monitor) we need to also enable `ssh` through USB.
To do so follow this guide https://desertbot.io/blog/ssh-into-pi-zero-over-usb
Once all those steps are followed the SD card can be unmounted and inserted into the Raspberry SD card reader.

Already isntalled libraries for accessing sensor data::
The pins in the Raspberry need some libraries before they can be used for communicating with different sensors.
For installing the required libraries run:

* `sudo apt-get install wiringpi`
* `sudo apt-get install pigpio`
* NodeJS can be installed with `nvm`
